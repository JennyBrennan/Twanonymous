# Twanonymous

A Chrome extension to hide profile pictures, names and usernames in Twitter feeds, searches and profiles. I made this as part of an internal Hack Week as a thought experiment for what it would be like to browse Twitter without knowing the identities of people Tweeting.

### How to install

1. Download this folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions and check the 'Developer mode' checkbox in the top right hand corner
3. Click 'Load an unpacked extension...' and select the Twanonymous folder you've downloaded onto your computer to install the extension

## How does it work?

Once you've activated the Chrome Extension, Twanonymous will automatically hide names, usernames and replace avatars with the default twitter avatar.

An icon (the default Twitter avatar) will appear to the right in your address bar. You can toggle anonymisation on and off by clicking the icon. When it's blue, Twanonymous is on.
